Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. Student at the Computing Institute of Fluminense Federal University (UFF) and IT Infrastructure Team Leader at Brazilian Development Bank.

My broad research area is software engineering, and my current research project is in software releases. The questions that motivate my research include:

  - What are the implications of rapid releases on software collaboration, quality, and security?
  - How to effectively mine release?

I'm also interested in other software engineering topics, such as software repository mining, infrastructure as code (IaC), DevOps, automated software engineering, and continuous deployment. I'm also interested in information security topics, including secure software development, access control, and blockchain.

I hold an M.Sc. (2009) degree in System Engineering and Computer Science from COPPE/UFRJ, an M.B.A. (2016) in Business Administration from COPPEAD/UFRJ, and a B.Eng. (2005) degree in Computer and Electronic Engineering from DEL/UFRJ. You can check my full resume at [LinkedIn].
