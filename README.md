Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am the Quality Assurance Team Leader at the Brazilian Development Bank, and
Independent Software Engineer and Cybersecurity Researcher (Ph.D).

You can find me online at my [Personal Site](https://felipecrp.github.io) and check my [blog posts](https://felipecrp.github.io/pos).

Moreover, I am developing the following open-source projects:

  - [releasy](https://github.com/gems-uff/releasy): a library for analyze releases;
  - [pytest-pyspec](https://github.com/felipecrp/pytest-pyspec): a
    Behavior-driven development plugin for _pytest_ that enables writing more user
    friendly tests using 'describe', 'with', and 'it' placeholders; and
  - [prchart](https://github.com/felipecrp/prchart): a library to create publish
    ready charts on top of _matplotlib_ that enables the use of a grammar of
    graphics.

Regards,
